Demoblaze environment notes

The exercise requests login with admin/admin. If the real environment does not accept it, the test documents the finding and intentionally marks the case as failed, with a note in the report.

Demoblaze does not allow editing quantities in the cart; the total is validated by adding the same product more than once.

There is no user profile on the site; it is simulated using localStorage to verify persistence of changes.

## ðŸ§ª Criteria coverage
- **Part 1**: setup, dependencies, config, and README.
- **Part 2**: login (+/âˆ’), categories, complete purchase.
- **Part 3**: checkout without product (negative), total validation with simulated quantity.
- **Part 4 (Bonus)**: HTML reporter with automatic screenshots, video, and trace on failures.
